# CryptoGraphyWebApp
This repository utilizes some of the functions in the Applied Cryptography respository and is bundled into a webapp. 
This webapp uses easy navigation between concepts and user input to showcase some basic cryptography concepts. Using servlets for server calls,
HTML5 & CSS for UI and JavaScript for input and display output, this allows for quick display of some of the ciphers and generators used in cryptography.
It is important to note that some ciphersr are still in progress and more ciphers and cipher features are on the way.

To view the main files I worked on: Navigate to 
Cryptography_Page-> src->main and then either Java for the servlet file and helper files or webapp for the webpages and scripts
