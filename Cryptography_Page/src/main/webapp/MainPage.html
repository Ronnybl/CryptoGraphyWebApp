	<h4>Goal</h4>
	<p>This website was built to showcase some of the ways information can be encrypted and decrypted. 
	You will see some ciphers such as Caesar cipher that date back to around 100 BC when Julius Caesar sent
	encrypted messages to his generals on the battlefield, as well as more modern ciphers. This includes DES, AES and the key distribution method Diffie-Hellman.</p>
	<h4>Inspiration</h4>
	<p>During my third year at York University, I took a course called Applied Cryptography, which taught me a lot of concepts in the field of cryptography.
	I found the ideas fascinating and how even before computers were around, protecting information was a big concern. After finishing my degree, I didn't want to 
	let my work in the class just gather dust on my computer, so I implemented this site hoping to demonstrate and pass on the information to you!</p>
	<h4>Credits</h4>
	<p>Although this site was built by myself and the ciphers were implemented by myself in Java, a tool file provided by York
	University's Hamzeh Roumani was used.</p>
	<h4>My Portfolio</h4>
